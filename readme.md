# Project: Noise Cancellation of Audio Signal using Convolutional Encoder

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a noise cancellation model for audio signals using a convolutional encoder. The dataset used for this project has been collected from the following source: [DataShare - Noise Cancellation Dataset](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2791).

## Training the Model
To ensure the model's compatibility and functionality, it is advisable to train the model on your local machine. There could be potential issues related to different versions of various packages. If you encounter any problems while using Torchaudio, consider using Librosa as an alternative.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [DataShare](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2791). Make sure to download the dataset from this location for your project.

Please note that you may need to explore the dataset and preprocess it according to your specific requirements for training the noise cancellation model.

Best of luck with your project!
